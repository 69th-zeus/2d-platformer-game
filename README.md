# 2D Platformer Game

This is a 2D platformer game written in python using the pygame library for my Software Engineering Lab Project. Currently there are 5 levels in it but in future i might make some more. 

I do not own nor do I claim to own the graphics used in the Game. They belong to their repective owners

# Working of the Game

It receives input from the keyboard upon which a simple physics running in the backend moves the character and calculates collisions and other stuff. Goal is to reach the Flag at the end of each level. There is also a Way to Save and Load Game although its pretty janky at the moment

Work on Menu Screen is going on as of now and will be added here some later. 

Also planning to introduce a second player option sometime later on.
